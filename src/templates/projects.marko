				##Â An example of a heading

				The designers job it's not seeing you be the Gatekeeper of your product full stop and the gate the designer becomes the Gatekeeper when all the decisions around the products are seen through the eyes of the designers visuals and cups and prototypes. I wonder if this is because many people see the relationship with the designer as a one dimensional relationship where the clients tells the designer what they want and expects the designer to be a person who was someone who can use the tools they cant.

				## What dreams may come

				When your faced with deadlines and you Need to build the  right product.   when you build the product from decisions alone and you have several other decisions you could have made how do you know you've made the right decision? [ it's not enough to think you Are successful from some an uplift in engagement,   increase in conversion, increase in revenue because. This doesn't answer whether you are meeting the needs of users it also doesn't tell you ] If something is unsuccessful either from tracking the conversion or a b testing and finding significant decrease in Analytics where do you look to to understand how to better your product if the only thing you have to go bye is an absolute conclusion.  we can of course try to find the data behind these conversions through the weeds of documentation and by talking but this puts the needs of the user or the learning further away from ourselves to be able to insure the building  the right product.

				## Something else

				Secondly the needs of the user often only change gradually where us the why don't you see those needs on map could change many times. if you don't capture the user's needs then how can you accurately assess whether your meeting them.

				Often people won't realise they're giving their design A specification rather than requirements or resources to do their job. I don't really know why this is however I have a French that it has something to do with the way that we imagine the solution to problems or the way we perceive how to achieve things.  perhaps when we solving a problem we don't always know what the problem is just that something isn't right therefore it's much easier to explain a problem in the shape of a solution there must be some reason why people do this so regularly. Perhaps it's a feature of our brains to save time. [ there must be some psychology to it]
