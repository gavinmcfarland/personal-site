				Simply helping you

				Hi I'm <em>Gavin</em>, and I work with people who want a great experience for their customers but need the help of someone who can describe how their product should behave and feel like. I work to tackle the hairy problems that are keeping you from reaching your best and laying the foundation for a better service that you can build on for years to come.

			<h2.f-5>About Me</h2>
			<p style="line-height: 1.6">I'm a designer at heart, but I've always been a problem solver. I select the right tools and the right methodologies to improve a situation the best I can. I strive to make things better. My forte lies in product design and user research. I devote a lot of my spare time to exploring how design decisions can be automated.</p>
			<p style="line-height: 1.6">When Iâ€™m not creating things, I like to cook, indulge in retro gaming and feed my lego obsession.</p>
