I wonder if this is because many people see the relationship with the designer as a one dimensional relationship where the clients tells the designer what they want and expects the designer to be a person who was someone who can use the tools they cant.\n\nwhen your faced with deadlines and you Need to build the  right product.   when you build the product from decisions alone and you have several other decisions you could have made how do you know you've made the right decision? [ it's not enough to think you Are successful from some an uplift in engagement,   increase in conversion, increase in revenue because. This doesn't answer whether you are meeting the needs of users it also doesn't tell you ] If something is unsuccessful either from tracking the conversion or a b testing and finding significant decrease in Analytics where do you look to to understand how to better your product if the only thing you have to go bye is an absolute conclusion.  we can of course try to find the data behind these conversions through the weeds of documentation and by talking but this puts the needs of the user or the learning further away from ourselves to be able to insure the building  the right product. \n\nSecondly the needs of the user often only change gradually where us the why don't you see those needs on map could change many times. if you don't capture the user's needs then how can you accurately assess whether your meeting them. \n\nOften people won't realise they're giving their design A specification rather than requirements or resources to do their job. I don't really know why this is however I have a French that it has something to do with the way that we imagine the solution to problems or the way we perceive how to achieve things.  perhaps when we solving a problem we don't always know what the problem is just that something isn't right therefore it's much easier to explain a problem in the shape of a solution there must be some reason why people do this so regularly. Perhaps it's a feature of our brains to save time. [ there must be some psychology to it]\n\nIf I was an engineer and I've been given the specifications to build an engine and while I was building an engine I found a part of the instructions which I knew or about didn't make sense, that would cause the engine to either break or run in efficiently I wouldn't just follow the instructions I would question them. There may be a good reason why the instructions said to do something a certain way but it may be that I don't have the knowledge all the information to inform me on this purpose. If I know you built the engine the way the instructions described then it could cost the company a lot of money.\n\nhowever in the case of follow following a specification in the project like ours it's hard to know when to stop questions. Because unless what the specification says is conventional or common knowledge then it's \n\nI don't think it's particularly hard to capture the user's needs because through the research in the work that you do not worry you'll often have the learnings already there it's just that when you speak about them or identify them in some way we miss crucial information that allows us to understand we are doing.  perhaps it comes naturally. I don't want to go on about why companies going staff with the user's needs because it's too difficult to understand how other people solve problems.  something that comes so naturally it's difficult to explain the process just someone with a completely different.  it's like trying to explain how language works when you don't speak the other person's language \n"}
