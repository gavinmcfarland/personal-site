## [Border Align](https://github.com/limitlessloop/postcss-border-align)

Simulates a border using box-shadow so you can create borders which do not affect layout just like you're used to in design programmes, for example `border: inside 2px solid red`.

## [Proportional Spacing](https://github.com/limitlessloop/postcss-proportional-spacing)

Allows you to create vertical and horizontal proportional spacing using ratios. For example if you want the bottom margin of a section to be twice as big as the top margin you can use `margin: 1em 1.5em 2`.

## [Negative Padding](https://github.com/limitlessloop/postcss-negative-padding)

A shortcut for applying negative margin and padding at the same time. This can be useful when you need to increase the hit area of a link without effecting the layout.

## [Color Shorthand](https://github.com/limitlessloop/postcss-color-shorthand)

Apply all color properties in one go. Useful when trying to manage themes.

## [Custom Values](https://github.com/limitlessloop/postcss-custom-values)

Lets you create your own CSS values such as keywords and units which can be limited to certain properties should you wish.
