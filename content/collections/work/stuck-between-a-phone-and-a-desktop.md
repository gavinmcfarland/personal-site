excerpt: Finding your identity as an iPad app is difficult. For _John Lewis_ this meant being somewhere between your popular iPhone app, and your trusty, long–standing, fully–featured desktop site. We set to understand our customers using the the iPad app, and to give it a purpose tailored to their needs.

        The main challenges user’s were having was difficulty navigating between departments and wanted more from their experience. In addition, the standard they were expecting was being pushed higher by other, smaller, independent apps. I worked with the business to understand the cause of these challenges, and offered advice for prioritising these issues. After understanding what the business wanted to achieve and what its customers wanted, work began within an agile team of 8-10 people to deliver changes over 6 months.
    sketching: |
        During the course of the project I organised a series of workshops were, where-by different activities were used to explore and tackle key topics. One of which consisted of the whole team sketching ideas and presenting them.
        
        [The activity works by where each person draws six ideas on a piece of paper in a space of five minutes. This process is then repeated for another five minutes to generate more ideas. Each person is then given ten minutes to develop and annotate their best ideas on another piece of paper, so the rest of the team can comment on them.
        
        The sketches are then stuck on a wall so each person can “dot” vote their favourite idea. Ideas to prototype were then determined by the product owner's final dot. The ideas with the most dots, formed the basis of the prototyping in the next workshop.]

##### Goal

Explore how the service might work and establish a proof of concept which can be used to help pitch the service to potential users and investors.

##### My Responsibilities

Investigate existing process, discover user pain points, conduct user interviews, information architecture, conceptual prototype.

##### Conclusion

The service went through many ideas for a business model and product solutions but without a way to visualise the service, it was difficult to quantify it’s value. Therefore creating a prototype helped demonstrate the problem they were solving for and how it could be achieved to present to both investors and stakeholders

## Current Rental Process

I thought it would be useful to get a better understanding of the details and events of the rental process. The flow diagram on the left is an early draft of a typical rental process in London. I’ve written hypothetical dates to get an understanding of the timeframe between events while thinking about the thoughts and feelings a renter might be having during this process.

## Product Conceptualisation

Conversations were starting to repeat themselves and we were spinning the same questions over and over. It was becoming hard for people imagine what the product does. We had identified a lot of needs and created a lot of ideas about what would meet those needs, but nothing about how physically they might be met or what the cost of those ideas were. We needed a way to think about how we might solve these problems without pigeonholing ourselves.

A technique I sometimes use is to create placeholders which represent a typical activity, like logging in, on boarding, viewing a list of properties, or viewing a profile. These placeholders can then be printed, rearranged and used in discussions. They don’t contain any content but help remind people of the type of activity that takes place in the holistic journey, without being bogged down in the detail.
