title: 10 Reasons Not to Break the Ice
tags: work
status: draft
client: Venntro
excerpt: As part of an audit to look for opportunities to improve the platform, one thing I noticed was the number of steps required for a user to send an Ice Breaker. Ice Breakers are used to encourage members to message each other. Once I created a site map of the existing functionality I worked out there were 10 opportunities where a member may decide to give up.

sections:
    research: |
        Previous research showed that only 7% of members will complete their profile the first time they visit the site, so I imagined that the same behaviour might apply for sending an ice breaker.
    conclusion: |
        I completed a fidelity prototype within the timeframe we agreed, updating the client on my progress so they could manage expectations with their team and investors. Given more time I would liked to have seen changes being made to both the Android version of the app and the iPhone app for a more consistent and universal experience across both devices.

##### Goal

Explore how the service might work and establish a proof of concept which can be used to help pitch the service to potential users and investors.

##### My Responsibilities

Investigate existing process, discover user pain points, conduct user interviews, information architecture, conceptual prototype.

##### Conclusion

The service went through many ideas for a business model and product solutions but without a way to visualise the service, it was difficult to quantify it’s value. Therefore creating a prototype helped demonstrate the problem they were solving for and how it could be achieved to present to both investors and stakeholders

## Current Rental Process

I thought it would be useful to get a better understanding of the details and events of the rental process. The flow diagram on the left is an early draft of a typical rental process in London. I’ve written hypothetical dates to get an understanding of the timeframe between events while thinking about the thoughts and feelings a renter might be having during this process.

## Product Conceptualisation

Conversations were starting to repeat themselves and we were spinning the same questions over and over. It was becoming hard for people imagine what the product does. We had identified a lot of needs and created a lot of ideas about what would meet those needs, but nothing about how physically they might be met or what the cost of those ideas were. We needed a way to think about how we might solve these problems without pigeonholing ourselves.

A technique I sometimes use is to create placeholders which represent a typical activity, like logging in, on boarding, viewing a list of properties, or viewing a profile. These placeholders can then be printed, rearranged and used in discussions. They don’t contain any content but help remind people of the type of activity that takes place in the holistic journey, without being bogged down in the detail.
