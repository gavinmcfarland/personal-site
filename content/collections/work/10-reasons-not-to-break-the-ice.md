excerpt: As part of an audit to look for opportunities to improve the a large white label dating company, one thing I noticed was the number of steps required for a user to send an Ice Breaker. Ice Breakers are used to encourage members to message each other. Once I decided to create a site map of the existing functionality and I found there were 10 opportunities where a member could decide to give up.

    research: |
        Previous research showed that only 7% of members will complete their profile the first time they visit the site, so I imagined that the same behaviour might apply for sending an ice breaker.

            <figcaption>This flow diagram shows the original steps required for a member to send an Ice Breaker. In particular it highlights a business need at point b to approve profile text for quality, spammers, fraud etc. But in this scenario it’s also discouraging good quality members from sending an ice Breaker.</figcaption>

    conclusion: |
        The solution was to eliminate any unnecessary steps for the user so that we could capitalise on their motivation at its peak (see flows on preceding pages for a comparison between the journeys). This change succeeded by increasing member engagement by over 300% the normal usage. It even overloaded the server at one point because we’d never had that many members send ice breakers at one time.

            <figcaption>The process for approving profile text is now deferred until after the member has written the Ice Breaker.</figcaption>
