    The navigation was particularly troublesome for the iPad app because compared to mobile and desktop it's identity was unique. We had been used to designing desktop sites which support large imagery, vasts amounts of content, dynamic and intricate navigation systems â€” and working for mobile we had learnt to figure out what the essentials were, allow customers to get to what they wanted quickly and simply; but with tablets we struggled to marry convenience with leisure.

    ## Workshops

    During the course of the project I organised and participated in various workshops. We used different activities to explore and tackle key topics.
    One activity consisted of the sketching ideas and presenting them to the team to give feedback. The activity works by where each person sketches six ideas on a piece of paper in a space of five minutes. After another round sketching for five minutes each person is then given ten minutes to develop and annotate their best ideas on another piece of paper where by the rest of the team can comment on them.

    ## Understanding the brief

    Our brief although fuelled by ambition was very wide. For us to measure our success we had to understand the brief better and set ourselves objectives which we could measure against. As it stood currently the app was functional and allowed customers to browse products, however to create something inspiring we had to understand what motivated our customers and what goals they were trying to achieve. As a result, we started by interviewing customers, researching white papers and learning about what affects inspiration. Our research showed that there were four main subjects that would lead to more inspired customers.

    ### Editorial content

    Articles that express expert opinion on different subjects like trends, buying advice, inspiration.

    ### Merchandising

    Products that are merchandise by seasonal trends, campaigns and promotions.

    ### Execution

    Vivid photography, typography, animations that appeal to our natural senses.

    ### Tools

    Tools that help customers envision their dreams and act on their inspiration.

    Describing interactions using wireframes, state diagrams and sketches.
    Navigation menu.

    This wireframe describes the information architecture and interactions between the two states of the menu being opened and closed. The wireframes were created in Antetype and then annotated in Omnigraffle. Building the wireframes in Antetype allowed me to build the wireframe using a fluid layout which made making alterations to the UI a lot easier.

    ## Departments menu

        The departments menu has a tree-menu-like interaction with subtle requirements that meant it would need to behaive in a particular way in certain circumstances. Traditionaliy this is quite hard to capture in a prototype or a wireframe, but using a state diagram allowed me to describe what the events were, that caused changes and how they should look before and after the change.

    ## Accessing account

    Although sketches are often seen as very disposable assets, I find them very useful for describing solutions which can be used as a base for descussion. The sketches above describe three options for handling sub navigation within the account area. Each option had a profoundly different effect on the experience when technical implementation were taken into full account.
