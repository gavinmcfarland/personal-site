    highlights: |
        - Working with the Department for International Trade I created a Design System which allowed them to develop and maintain their services during a digital transformation for customers importing and exporting goods in relation to the UK. The Design System enabled the team to create features quickly in a consistent manner while meeting customers needs across a broad range of persona types.
        - Research of the John Lewis iPad App showed that customers’ browsing habits were not fully supported. I organised workshops and tested new designs with customers. We succeeded in driving changes to the navigation and browsing of content which substantially increased sales and downloads. The iPad App gained a 4.5 rating on the App store.
        - Working with Venntro I helped to increase the number of complete profiles on their dating platform. To start only a small percentage of customers completed their profile. I interviewed customers to understand their dating habits and assessed usability pain points. By introducing users to the profile creation process earlier on we increased completed profiles by 4 times of what it was before.
