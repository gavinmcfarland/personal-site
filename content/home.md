    about: |
        My name's Gavin, I'm a freelance designer working in London. I've always been a problem solver. I choose the right tools and the right methodologies to improve a situation the best I can. I strive to make things better. My forte lies in product design and user research. I devote a lot of my spare time to exploring how design decisions can be automated.
        
        When Iâ€™m not creating things, I like to cook, indulge in retro gaming and feed my lego obsession.
