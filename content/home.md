    about: |
        Hi, Iâ€™m Gavin. I like making things and working with people to solve problems. I enjoy exploring ideas around Design Systems and have created a few PostCSS [plugins](https://github.com/limitlessloop?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=postcss&type=&language=) which make managing them easier. If you want to get more formal, you can view an abridged version of my [CV](/cv).

        This site was designed and built by myself using [Figma](https://figma.com), [Marko](http://markojs.com) and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org). Bundled with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and hosted on [Now](https://zeit.co).
